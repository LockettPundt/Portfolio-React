    <p>
      I&apos;m a musician at heart who has been extremely fortunate to travel the world
      playing music for most of my adult life. I&apos;ve had an incredible journey and
      made invaluable friends along the way. I have also fallen for programming and
      creating things digitally. The parallels between music and Web Development are
      such that it was a seemless transition to jump right in. The creative process, the
      &apos;aha!&apos; moments and the satisfaction of honing a skill through hard work and
      study, all echo back to my journey with music and songwriting. I look forward to 
      where this new chapter takes me...
