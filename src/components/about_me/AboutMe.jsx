    <p>
      I&apos;m an enthusiastic Web/Software Developer who has turned a curiosity
      into a reality. I enrolled in DigitalCrafts&apos;s immersive Full Stack Web Development
      course in January of 2020 to realize a growing interest.

      I&apos;m a musician at heart who has been extremely fortunate to travel the world
      playing music for most of my adult life. I&apos;ve had an incredible journey and
      made invaluable friends along the way. I have also fallen for programming and
      creating things digitally. The parallels between music and Web Development are
      such that it was a seemless transition to jump right in. The creative process, the
      &apos;aha!&apos; moments and the satisfaction of honing a skill through hard work and
      study, all echo back to my journey with music and songwriting. The pursuit of growing as
      a developer is very exciting and it&apos;s wild to look back just a few months to see the
      parallax of what I knew then, versus what I know now (with also being more aware of how much I
      don&apos;t know!). I&apos;m very much looking forward to learning more and pushing
      myself ahead.
