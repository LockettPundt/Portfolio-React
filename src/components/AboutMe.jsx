    <p>
      I'm an enthusiastic Web/Software Developer who has turned a curiosity
      into a reality. I enrolled at DigitalCrafts in January of 2020 to
      study Full Stack Web Development and take a budding passion to the next level.

      I'm a musician at heart who has been extremely fortunate to travel the world
      playing music for most of my adult life. I've had an incredible journey and
      made invaluable friends, but I felt the need to broaden my horizon to
      include something outside of music. I have fallen in love with programming and
      building things digitally. The parallels between music and Web Development are
      such that it was a seemless transition to jump right in. I'm very excited to begin
      a new chapter and continue learning.
